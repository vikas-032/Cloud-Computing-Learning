What is cloud computing?

Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing resources—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the Internet (“the cloud”) so that individuals and businesses can use powerful computing tools without owning or managing physical hardware themselves.

Key Concepts

1. On-Demand Internet Delivery
Instead of storing data or running software on your own device or local server, cloud computing lets you access these resources over the internet from remote servers maintained by cloud providers.

2. No Large Upfront Costs
With cloud computing, you typically pay only for the services and resources you use (pay-as-you-go), eliminating the need to buy and maintain expensive hardware.

3. Scalability and Flexibility
Cloud resources can be scaled up or down quickly based on demand. This means you can get more power or storage when you need it, and reduce it when you don’t, without manual hardware changes.
