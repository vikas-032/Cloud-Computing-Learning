Amazon EC2 pricing
With Amazon EC2, you pay only for the compute time that you use.
Amazon EC2 offers a variety of pricing options for different use cases. For example, if your use case can withstand interruptions, you can save with Spot Instances.
You can also save by committing early and locking in a minimum level of use with Reserved Instances.
