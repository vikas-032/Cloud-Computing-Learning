AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) is the AWS service used to securely control who can access your 
AWS resources and what they can do with them. It’s core to AWS security and access governance.

What IAM Does

Authentication & Authorization: IAM manages who can sign in (authenticate) and what actions they are allowed to perform (authorize) across AWS services.

Centralized Control: You define identities (users, groups, roles) and permissions policies that determine access to AWS resources.

Least Privilege: You can grant fine-grained permissions so identities only get the access they actually need. 



1) What Are EC2 Instance Types?

EC2 instance types are configurations of virtual hardware (CPU, memory, storage, network) designed for different workloads. Each type is grouped into a family based on the resources it prioritizes. When you launch an instance, the selected type determines the underlying hardware resources your virtual machine gets.

🧠 2) Main Categories of EC2 Instance Types

Here are the primary families you should know:

📌 1. General-Purpose Instances

Provide a balanced mix of CPU, memory, and networking.

Suitable for web servers, small/medium databases, development/test environments.

Examples: t2, t3, t3a, t4g, m5, m6g, m7i

T-series (t2/t3/t4g): Burstable performance — good baseline CPU with the ability to "burst" above it.
M-series (m5/m6/m7): Balanced, fixed-performance general-purpose.

📈 2. Compute-Optimized Instances

Designed for CPU-intensive workloads needing high processing power.

Use cases: batch processing, high-performance web servers, media transcoding.

Examples: c5, c6g, c7g, c8gn

🧠 3. Memory-Optimized Instances

Offer large RAM footprints for memory-intensive applications.

Use cases: in-memory databases, big data analytics, caching.

Examples: r5, r6g, r7i, x1, x2idn, z1d, High-Memory families

⚡ 4. Accelerated Computing Instances

Include hardware accelerators like GPUs or custom chips.

Use cases: machine learning, graphics processing, inference tasks.

Examples: p4d, g5, inf1, trn1, f1

💾 5. Storage-Optimized Instances

Optimized for high, low-latency local storage operations.

Use cases: high-throughput databases, big data workloads requiring heavy disk I/O.

Examples: i3, i4i, d3, h1, i7i

🚀 6. High-Performance Computing (HPC) Instances

Tailored for large-scale compute clusters and complex simulations.

Examples: hpc6a, hpc7a, hpc7g
What General-Purpose Instances Are

General-purpose EC2 instances are designed to provide a balanced mix of compute (CPU), memory (RAM), and networking capacity. They are versatile and suitable for workloads that do not require specialized emphasis on any one of these dimensions. These instances are AWS’s go-to choice when you need reliable performance across a broad set of tasks.

In AWS parlance, General-Purpose means you don’t pay for extreme performance in compute or memory alone — instead, you get a well-rounded resource profile that works well for most applications.

🧠 Why They Matter

General-purpose instances are:

Balanced: CPU, memory, and network are sized to work together efficiently.

Cost-effective: You avoid over-provisioning one resource at the expense of others.

Flexible: Suitable for many real-world production workloads.

These qualities make them excellent for applications where you don’t know exactly which resource might become the bottleneck — in contrast to compute-optimized or memory-optimized instances.

🧱 Main Families (General-Purpose) & Key Traits
📍 T Series – Burstable Performance

Examples: T2, T3, T3a, T4g

Designed for workloads with variable CPU usage — light usage most of the time, occasional spikes.

Uses a CPU credit system:

Earn credits when idle

Spend credits during bursts beyond baseline CPU

Can run at high CPU for short bursts without paying for expensive always-on CPU capacity

Good for:

Small/medium websites

Microservices

Development/testing environments

Code repos and CI/CD runners

How T Series works:
T instances accumulate CPU credits at a baseline rate; when workloads exceed that baseline, they use the credits to “burst” higher. This makes them both economical and responsive for workloads with unpredictable demand.

📍 M Series – Fixed, Balanced Performance

Examples: M5, M6g, M6i, M7g (and variants with ‘d’, ‘n’, etc.)

Not burstable — they deliver consistent performance based on instance size.

Excellent for general enterprise workloads that need a steady balance of CPU + memory.

Some variants include:

d → local NVMe SSD storage (fast local disk)

n → enhanced networking

a → AMD processors (cost-optimized)

g → Graviton (ARM) high price-performance ›

Typical use cases for M series:

Web & application servers

Small/medium databases

Enterprise applications (e.g., customer apps, backend services)

Caching fleets & cluster computing
