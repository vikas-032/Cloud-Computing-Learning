AWS EC2 + S3 Cloud Project README

# AWS Cloud Project – EC2 and S3 Integration

## 📌 Description
This project demonstrates deploying a virtual server on AWS EC2 and integrating it with S3 storage.

---

## 🔧 Services Used
- Amazon EC2
- Amazon S3
- IAM
- VPC
- Security Groups

---

## 🏗️ Architecture
Client → EC2 Instance → S3 Bucket

---

## 🚀 Implementation Steps
1. Launch EC2 instance
2. Configure IAM role for S3 access



3. Create and attach S3 bucket
4. Upload and retrieve data from EC2

---

## 🔐 Security

AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) is the AWS service used to securely control who can access your 
AWS resources and what they can do with them. It’s core to AWS security and access governance.

What IAM Does

Authentication & Authorization: IAM manages who can sign in (authenticate) and what actions they are allowed to perform (authorize) across AWS services.

Centralized Control: You define identities (users, groups, roles) and permissions policies that determine access to AWS resources.

Least Privilege: You can grant fine-grained permissions so identities only get the access they actually need. 



1) What Are EC2 Instance Types?

EC2 instance types are configurations of virtual hardware (CPU, memory, storage, network) designed for different workloads. Each type is grouped into a family based on the resources it prioritizes. When you launch an instance, the selected type determines the underlying hardware resources your virtual machine gets.

🧠 2) Main Categories of EC2 Instance Types

Here are the primary families you should know:

📌 1. General-Purpose Instances

Provide a balanced mix of CPU, memory, and networking.

Suitable for web servers, small/medium databases, development/test environments.

Examples: t2, t3, t3a, t4g, m5, m6g, m7i

T-series (t2/t3/t4g): Burstable performance — good baseline CPU with the ability to "burst" above it.
M-series (m5/m6/m7): Balanced, fixed-performance general-purpose.

📈 2. Compute-Optimized Instances

Designed for CPU-intensive workloads needing high processing power.

Use cases: batch processing, high-performance web servers, media transcoding.

Examples: c5, c6g, c7g, c8gn

🧠 3. Memory-Optimized Instances

Offer large RAM footprints for memory-intensive applications.

Use cases: in-memory databases, big data analytics, caching.

Examples: r5, r6g, r7i, x1, x2idn, z1d, High-Memory families

⚡ 4. Accelerated Computing Instances

Include hardware accelerators like GPUs or custom chips.

Use cases: machine learning, graphics processing, inference tasks.

Examples: p4d, g5, inf1, trn1, f1

💾 5. Storage-Optimized Instances

Optimized for high, low-latency local storage operations.

Use cases: high-throughput databases, big data workloads requiring heavy disk I/O.

Examples: i3, i4i, d3, h1, i7i

🚀 6. High-Performance Computing (HPC) Instances

Tailored for large-scale compute clusters and complex simulations.

Examples: hpc6a, hpc7a, hpc7g
