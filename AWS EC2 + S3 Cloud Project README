AWS EC2 + S3 Cloud Project README

# AWS Cloud Project – EC2 and S3 Integration

## 📌 Description
This project demonstrates deploying a virtual server on AWS EC2 and integrating it with S3 storage.

---

## 🔧 Services Used
- Amazon EC2
- Amazon S3
- IAM
- VPC
- Security Groups

---

## 🏗️ Architecture
Client → EC2 Instance → S3 Bucket

---

## 🚀 Implementation Steps
1. Launch EC2 instance
2. Configure IAM role for S3 access



3. Create and attach S3 bucket
4. Upload and retrieve data from EC2

---

## 🔐 Security
- IAM role-based access
- SSH key authentication
- Restricted inbound rules

---

## 📊 Results
- Secure data storage using S3
- Reliable compute using EC2
- Cloud-native architecture

---


## 🧠 Skills Gained
- EC2 provisioning
- IAM role configuration
- Cloud storage integration

AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) is the AWS service used to securely control who can access your 
AWS resources and what they can do with them. It’s core to AWS security and access governance.

What IAM Does

Authentication & Authorization: IAM manages who can sign in (authenticate) and what actions they are allowed to perform (authorize) across AWS services.

Centralized Control: You define identities (users, groups, roles) and permissions policies that determine access to AWS resources.

Least Privilege: You can grant fine-grained permissions so identities only get the access they actually need.
